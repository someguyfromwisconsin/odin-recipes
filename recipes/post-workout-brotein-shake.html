    <h2>Brotein Shake</h2>
        <p>Yo. You just finished a hardcore workout, but you're mildly lactose intolerant so you need some protein without the secretions of a cow, right? Well, I got the shake for you. Let's twist this.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Swole muscles</li>
            <li>A blender, like a Ninja</li>
            <li>6 oz of almond "milk," or any other liquid that pretends to be milk but ain't</li>
            <li>Protein powder. Whatever you like. I use MÃ–LK</li>
            <li>Banana</li>
            <li>Ice cubes</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Cooking Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Throw all the ingredients in the blender at the same time and hit the blend button. If you have a fancy blender like I do, I guess you could hit the "chop," "puree," or "stir." I honestly don't have a clue what they do. Just push something.</li>
            <li>If it's too thin, add some more ice cubes. If it's too thick...well, I guess you could add water or something.</li>
            <li>Pound it.</li>
        </ol>
