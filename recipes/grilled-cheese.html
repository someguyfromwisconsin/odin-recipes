    <h1>Grilled Cheese</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Seriously. This is a recipe for a grilled cheese sandwich. Just try and mess it up. I dare you. I mean, I guess it's possible to screw it up and set your stove on fire. Yeah, don't do that. Just cook the damn sandwich.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Bread. Any bread works, really. As long as you can slice it so the holey bread parts are on both sides.</li>
            <li>Cheese. Any cheese you want. Cheddar is a classic. Goat is weird, but oddly tastes good. What's the stinky one? I guess you could do that one. Why not try whatever you got available in your fridge? If you're cooking grilled cheese, likely you haven't thought through your way well enough to be prepared for cooking. So, yeah, grab whatever cheese you like.</li>
            <li>Butter, or not if you're monster and like dry bread.</li>
            <li>Whatever else you want. Mustard? Sure. Jalapenos? Why not? Mayo? I mean, I'm not your mom. Do whatever you want, weirdo.</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Cooking Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat up the pan and slap some butter on that bad boy.</li>
            <li>Slather some butter on one side of each slice of bread.</li>
            <li>Squirt some mustard or whatever else you like on the other side of the bread. Add whatever else you want, too.</li>
            <li>Gently lay slices of cheese on <strong>ONLY</strong> one slice of bread, right on top of the <em>gooey</em> condiment you just put on there. Just one side. If you put it on both sides, cheese is gonna fly everywhere on the next step.</li>
            <li>Put them slices of bread together.</li>
            <li>There's cheese everywhere now, huh? Idiot.</li>
            <li>Well, with what you have left....ahh, who am I kidding? Pick that cheese up off the floor and put it back in the sandwich. Who cares.</li>
            <li>Is the pan hot, yet? Good. Slap that sandy on.</li>
            <li>Find a spatula or something flat and check the bottom of that bread to see if it's golden brown. Is it? Good. Flip it.</li>
            <li>Repeat for that side now.</li>
            <li>Take it off. Now, you probably put too much cheese on it so it's not all melted. So, you're gonna have to stick in the microwave. How long? I don't know. 20 seconds? Just stare at it until the cheese looks like it's melted and pray to God that the bread doesn't get all soggy.</li>
            <li>Now, eat it. Burn the roof of your mouth because you can't wait another second.</li>
        </ol>
